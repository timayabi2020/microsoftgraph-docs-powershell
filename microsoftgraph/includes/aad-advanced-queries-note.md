> [!NOTE]
> Some requests for Azure Active Directory resources require the use of advanced query capabilities. If you get a response indicating a bad request, unsupported query, or a response that includes unexpected results, including the `$count` query parameter and `ConsistencyLevel` header may allow the request to succeed. For details and examples, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries?tabs=powershell).
